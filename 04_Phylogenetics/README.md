# Phylogenetic analyses 

## Create BEAUTI file using BEAST v1.10.4
- I used a Speciation: Birth-Death Process tree prior, relaxed lognormal clock, and a HKY subsitution model. We also ran the analysis for 50 MCMC cycles, sampling every 5,000 and discarding the first 5 million stats as burn-in. See screenshots of the beauti tabs for more information. 
- move into my local cluster ->  `rsync -avz --progress ~/Desktop/BNS_PakistanwolvesNov1_finalJun24.xml hennelly@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:/group/ctbrowngrp2/hennelly/hennelly/Pakistan_Graywolf_Genomics/Mitogenome/Beast`

## Run Beast
- Running Beast ->  01_beast.sh
- Running treeannotator -> 02_treeannotator.sh
- move log file to see run on Tracer: `BNS_PakistanwolvesNov1_finalJun24.log.txt`
